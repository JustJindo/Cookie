Pasta Carbonara

What you'll need:

- eggs
- pasta
- bacon
- parmesan
- salt and pepper

What you'll do:

1. Heat a skillet to medium-high heat and add olive oil.
2. Fill a pot with salted water. Set to boil at high heat.
3. Cut bacon into small pieces.
4. When oil starts to shimmer, add bacon.
5. Once water boils, add pasta.
6. Crack an egg into a heap of parmesan and mix.
   (The mixture should be less viscous than batter. Too thick? Add pasta water or crack another egg. Too thin? Add more parmesan.)
7. When fat from bacon is fully rendered, lower heat to simmer and remove bacon from pan.
8. When pasta is done, drain and add to fat.
9. Take pan off heat.
10. Return bacon to pan and mix everything around.
11. Add mixture and keep everything moving until sauce has thickened to your liking.

Easy pasta! I make it when I'm feeling cheesy.
