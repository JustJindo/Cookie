Stir Fry

What you'll need:

- some meat
- olive oil
- some vegetables
- salt and pepper
- soy sauce
- stock
- honey (optional)

What you'll do:

1. Heat a wok to high heat and add olive oil.
2. Cut meat into bite-size pieces and season with salt and pepper.
3. When oil starts to shimmer, add meat.
4. When meat has browned, remove from wok.
5. Add olive oil to wok.
6. Add vegetables, salt and pepper.
7. While vegetables cook, mix soy sauce and stock in another container.
   (Add honey to the mixture if you like teriyaki sauce.)
8. When vegetables are cooked, return meat to wok.
9. Add mixture and stir fry until reduced.

Everything can be stir fried. I like to do stir fry with a bootleg teriyaki sauce, but do whatever feels (and tastes) right to you!
